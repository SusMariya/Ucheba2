Hello!
A closure is a combination of a function and a set 
references to variables in the scope of the function. 
The latter is sometimes called a reference environment. 
Closure allows you to perform a function outside
the scope. In Python, the reference environment is stored
as a set of cells.  а может быть и  не так
